# Windows 95 Portfolio Project Details

## Icon Implementation
All icons in the project use Windows 95-style .ico files. The following placeholders are set up in the HTML and will be replaced with actual Windows 95 .ico files:

### Current Icons
- `images/w98_keyboard_musical_midi.ico` - Music application icon (implemented)

### Placeholder Icons (To Be Replaced)
- `images/folder.ico` - Used for:
  - Work for Clients.exe
  - Proficiencies.exe
  - Motion Design.exe
  - d3.exe
- `images/notepad.ico` - Used for:
  - Resume.txt

## Implementation Notes
- Icons are referenced from the `images/` directory
- All icons should be Windows 95 .ico format for authenticity
- Icon dimensions are handled by CSS in the `windows95.css` file
- Icons appear in both the desktop shortcuts and window title bars when applicable
